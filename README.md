# Channel Command
Switch channels via chat command

### Chat commands:
!channel [channel_number]'
!ch [channel_number]'
!c [channel_number]'

All 3 commands do the exact samething.
Commands are not case-sensitive.

[slash](https://github.com/baldera-mods/slash) is supported but not required

### Example
!channel 3
Will switch you to channel 3

### Things to know
* Changing channels while inside a dungeon will teleport you out.
* Changing to a channel number that doesn't exist will send you to channel 1
